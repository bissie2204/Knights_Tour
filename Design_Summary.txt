Goal:
Produce a practical solver and visualizer for the standard 8x8 Knight's Tour problem.


Key design decisions:

Algorithm: Warnsdorff's heuristic

It is simple, computationally cheap, and successful for generating full tours on standard chessboards.

At each step, the heuristic chooses the unvisited neighbor with the minimum "onward degree".

This algorithm is efficient and runs extremely fast on an 8x8 board.


Tie-breaking strategy

Tie-breaking among equal-degree moves is critical: deterministic first-choice tie-breaking can fail for some starting positions.

Implemented randomized tie-breaking and a retries loop. Repeated randomized trials greatly increase the chance of finding a full tour without implementing expensive full backtracking.

A configurable max_retries parameter allows trading compute time for success probability.


Visualization

Matplotlib chosen for portability and ease-of-use.

The board is drawn as a checkerboard; the path is displayed with numbered nodes and connecting lines for readability.

The visualization supports interactive starting-position selection with a mouse click.

API and UX

Command-line interface with options:

--start accepts algebraic notation (e4) or two integers (row col).

--no-visual for headless runs.

--retries to tune robustness.

Interactive selection (default when --start omitted) uses a click on the matplotlib board.

Correctness vs. simplicity

A full backtracking solver guarantees a solution if one exists, but is more complex to implement and slower in practice for 8x8.

Warnsdorff + randomized tie-breaking is a pragmatic compromise: simple, fast, and successful in practice while keeping the code approachable and well-commented.

Reproducibility

Randomization is used; to reproduce a successful run, insert a random.seed(some_int) before find_tour_with_retries.

The code prints the chosen path in algebraic format for external verification.

Complexity

Time per trial is O(N^2 * k) where k is constant bounded by the number of knight moves (≤8). For N=8, this is negligible.

Memory is O(N^2) for the visited matrix and path.
